     Note that when the @racket[mode] is @racket['outline] or @racket["outline"], the shape
     may draw outside of its bounding box and thus parts of the image may disappear
     when it is cropped. See @secref["nitty-gritty"] (in the @seclink["image-guide"])
     for a more careful explanation of the ramifications of this fact.

     If the @racket[_mode] argument is @racket['outline] or @racket["outline"], then the last
     argument can be a @racket[pen] struct or an @racket[image-color?], but if the @racket[_mode]
     is @racket['solid] or @racket["solid"], then the last argument must be an
     @racket[image-color?].}))

     Some shapes (notably those with @racket['outline] or @racket["outline"] as
          the @racket[_mode] argument) draw outside of their bounding boxes and thus
          cropping them may remove part of them (often the lower-left and lower-right
          edges). See @secref["nitty-gritty"] (in the @seclink["image-guide"])
          for a more careful discussion of this issue.
